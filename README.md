  **About this code:**

    This code provides a Scientific Calculator function using C++ programming language. 
    Inside this code, there are several primary feature such as: basic arithmetic (+ - * /), 
    advanced arithmetic (square root, exp, log, ln), trigonometry function (sin cos tan), and
    history function where you can display the calculator's history and delete it.
    We also provide additional feature such as: advanced trigonometry function (arcsin, arccos,
    and arctan), guide menu, invalid input checking, and customized function where you can mix more
    than 2 functions in the calculator.

  **Calculator Menu Explanation**

    Basic Mathematic Operations:
    When a user selects one of the basic mathematic operations, they are prompted to specify the 
    quantity of input values. Subsequently, the calculator requests the numbers from the user, performs 
    the specified operation on the input values, and outputs the result.
    - Addition: Allows users to add together multiple integers.
    - Subtraction: Allows subtraction of multiple integers.
    - Multiplication: The process of multiplying two or more integers.
    - Division: Allows for operations involving division.

    Additional Mathematical Operations:
    For functions such as square root, exponents, and logarithms, the calculator requests the necessary 
    input from the user and, upon receiving the input, proceeds to perform the calculation. The final 
    result is then displayed to the user.
    - Square Root: Calculates the square root of the specified integer.
    - Exponents: Calculates the result of elevating a given number to the specified exponent.
    - Logarithms Base 10: Computes the base 10 logarithm of a number.
    - Logarithms with Custom Base: Computes the logarithm of a number with a base specified by the user.
    - Natural Logarithm (ln): Computes the natural logarithm (base e) of a given number.

    Trigonometric Function: 
    Users are prompted to select between sine, cosine, or tangent for basic trigonometric functions 
    (or arccosine, arcsine, or arctangent in advanced mode). They provide the angle, specified either 
    in degrees (or as a number for arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent) and the calculator proceeds 
    to compute and display the result.
    - Basic Trigonometry Function: Allows users to select between sine, cosine, and tangent degree calculations.
    - Advanced Trigonometry Function: Provides options for calculating arccosine, arcsine, and arctangent.

    Calculator History:
    Users can observe the history of previous calculations by selecting "Show History List." Within the history, 
    both the original calculation and its result are displayed. If desired, the user has the option to delete 
    the calculator's history, effectively erasing the list of prior calculations.
    - Show History List: This option displays a list of previous calculations with their results
    - Delete Calculator History: Empties the calculator's history list

    Customized Function:
    In this function, users can combine the function provided to calculate. So, the calculation is not limited
    between functions. For example, using this function, you can do 7 + sin(30) x 9 + ln(9).
