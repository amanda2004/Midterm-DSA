  **About this code:**

    This code provides a Scientific Calculator function using C++ programming language. 
    Inside this code, there are several primary feature such as: basic arithmetic (+ - * /), 
    advanced arithmetic (square root, exp, log, ln), trigonometry function (sin cos tan), and
    history function where you can display the calculator's history and delete it.
    We also provide additional feature such as: advanced trigonometry function (arcsin, arccos,
    and arctan), guide menu, invalid input checking, and customized function where you can mix more
    than 2 functions in the calculator.
